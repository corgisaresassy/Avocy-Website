                    Avocy offers up to insurance-covered telehealth therapy to people of all ages recovering from substance use disorder and other mental health issues. We understand it can be difficult to connect with a new therapist when you only meet once per week. To overcome this challenge, we recommend and encourage patients to meet with their therapist twice a week for the first month. 
                    <br><br>
                    At Avocy, we accept most major insurance plans. For most patients, the copay associated with two sessions is still less than the cost of one session with a private therapist. We believe no one should have to choose between living and self-care. Contact us today to learn more about your insurance and how Avocy can help you move forward.

                <h4>How Does Therapy Work?</h4>
                <p>
                    Therapy is about having a safe place for self-reflection, for understanding actions and responses, and for self-exploration. Managing the human condition is a skill. Whether it come to managing intrusive thoughts, fears, grief, or finding purpose and direction, a therapist can help you explore your inner thoughts. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="flexcard">

                <h4>Is Therapy Right For Me?</h4>
                <p>
                    At some point in life, everyone will benefit from therapy. Relationships, loss, failure, and depression are common occurrences. Navigating complex emotions can be challenging and overwhelming. Therapy isn’t about telling you the answer, but helping you to understand your own emotions and feelings to make more informed decisions. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="flexcard">
                <img class="flexcardimg" src="images/clock.svg">
                <h4>When Can I Expect Results? </h4>
                <p>
                    Therapy doesn’t have a finish line. It also doesn’t always feel good to explore underlying trauma and emotions. Therapy is a process of self-discovery and learning. You’ll work with your therapist to discuss your short-term and long-term goals, and our team will support you across every step.
